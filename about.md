#A lighthearted take on life in the Tech World as a woman and mother.

##I Blog About:

* Coding and Learning to Code
* Parenting
* Random Nonsense That Pops Into My Brain

## Facts About Me:

* An umbilical cord runs from my fingers to a Macbook keyboard.
* 3 years ago I acquired a giggling shadow that hangs from my shirt-tail and smells like peanut butter.
* 5 years ago I cloned myself and forgot to swap out the “gets lost in one’s own house” gene.
* 10 years ago I found a Sasquatch, realized he’s cotton candy on the inside, and made a pact that when we’re old, one of us will change the other one’s diapers.
* "#{time_ago_in_words}" + "ago", I started this blog to tell the world how crazy I am.
